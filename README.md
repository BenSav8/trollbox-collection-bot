# Trollbox Collection Bot
***
a template for trollbox collection bots
you need to install these npm packages first:
- socket.io-client version 2:
`npm install socket.io-client@2`
- lodash
`npm install lodash`

this template has three main commands:
- collect - makes you collect a random item
- dex - outputs how many items you / someone else has (according to home)
- lookup - checks if you have an item

you have to put your collectables in collectables.json, like how it is initially structured
you may also adjust the script to work / be consistent with your bot
